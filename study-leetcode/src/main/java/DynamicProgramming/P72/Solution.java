 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
 * rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
 * rose -> ros (remove 'e')
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * intention -> inention (remove 't')
 * inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
 * enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
 * exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
 * exection -> execution (insert 'u')
 *
 *
 *
 * 解题思路:
 *
 *
 * Let following be the function definition :-
 *
 * f(i, j) := minimum cost (or steps) required to convert first i characters of word1 to first j characters of word2
 *
 * Case 1: word1[i] == word2[j], i.e. the ith the jth character matches.
 *
 * f(i, j) = f(i - 1, j - 1)
 *
 * Case 2: word1[i] != word2[j], then we must either insert, delete or replace, whichever is cheaper
 *
 * f(i, j) = 1 + min { f(i, j - 1), f(i - 1, j), f(i - 1, j - 1) }
 *
 * f(i, j - 1) represents insert operation
 * f(i - 1, j) represents delete operation
 * f(i - 1, j - 1) represents replace operation
 * Here, we consider any operation from word1 to word2. It means, when we say insert operation, we insert a new character after word1 that matches the jth character of word2. So, now have to match i characters of word1 to j - 1 characters of word2. Same goes for other 2 operations as well.
 *
 * Note that the problem is symmetric. The insert operation in one direction (i.e. from word1 to word2) is same as delete operation in other. So, we could choose any direction.
 *
 * Above equations become the recursive definitions for DP.
 *
 * Base Case:
 *
 * f(0, k) = f(k, 0) = k
 *
